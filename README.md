# Lab-Movidius
In the lab work you will get familiar with Raspberry Pi and its environment. The purpose of the lab work is to create real-time object detection algorithm for machine vision, which will use external GPU. We will work in Raspbian Stretch operational system and use Python3 for coding. You will also get familiar with Linux command line, basics of `opencv`, `numpy`, `mvncapi` libraries.
