# Lab-Movidius
Since it easy to google every task please please please try to undestand what's going on. The "just answer" thing will be not counted, make sure to present derivation of your solution. It is absolutely OK if you found an answer on web then just exercise in $\LaTeX$ copying it into here. A good way to derive solutions for these tasks is to derive it for single elements and then generalize to the resulting matrix/vector.
