# Lab-Movidius
In the lab work you will get familiar with Raspberry Pi and its environment. The purpose of the lab work is to create real-time object detection algorithm for machine vision, which will use external GPU. We will work in Raspbian Stretch operational system and use Python3 for coding. You will also get familiar with Linux command line, basics of `opencv`, `numpy`, `mvncapi` libraries.

## Raspberry Warm-Up
Ctrl+alt+T
`cd`
`ls`
`pwd`
navigate to realtime-object-detection
make sure you are in this directory

`nano`
`mkdir`
`rmdir` or `rm -rf`
`rm`
`cp`
make directory practice, create text file, write hello world, move to realtime-object-detection, remove practice directory

`whoami`
what is the name of your sudo?
`cat /etc/os-release`
what is the os you use?
`df -h`
how much memory do you have?
`tor`

`ifconfig`

`sudo apt-get update`(updates the list of available packages and their versions) and `sudo apt-get upgrade` (actually installs the newer
versions of packages you have)
`sudo apt-get install vim`
python -> tqdm
`pip install tqdm`
short program in python, which writes the version of the lib tqdm
